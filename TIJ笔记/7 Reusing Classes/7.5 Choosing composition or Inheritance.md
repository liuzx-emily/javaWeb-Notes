Composition is generally used when you want the features of an existing class inside your new class, but not its interface. That is, you embed an object so that you can use it to implement features in your new class, but the user of your new class sees the interface youâ€™ve defined for the new class rather than the interface from the embedded object. For this effect, you embed private objects of existing classes inside your new class.  

Sometimes it makes sense to allow the class user to directly access the composition of your new class; that is, to make the member objects public. The member objects use implementation hiding themselves, so this is a safe thing to do.
