- 每个编译单元（文件）都只能有0或1个public 类。

- public类的名字必须与文件的名字相同，包括大小写形式。  
 eg: Ab2C.java中的public类必须叫做Ab2C

- 允许有一个.java没有任何public类。此时，可按自己的意愿任意指定文件名。

想要把class隐藏起来，让它在package之外不能用的话：  
you just leave the **public** keyword off the class, in which case it has **package access**. （That class can be used only within that package.） 
 
不能把类设为private 或protected 。所以类只可能是public 或default-package access

---
若不愿其他任何人访问那个类，可将所有constructor 设为private 。

    //: access/Lunch.java
    public class Lunch {
    	void testPrivate() {
    		// Can’t do this! Private constructor:
    		// ! Soup1 soup = new Soup1();
    	}
    
    	void testStatic() {
    		Soup1 soup = Soup1.makeSoup();
    	}
    
    	void testSingleton() {
    		Soup2.access().f();
    	}
    }
    
    class Soup1 {
    	private Soup1() {
    	}
    
    	public static Soup1 makeSoup() {	//返回的是类Soup1的一个对象的引用
    		return new Soup1();
    	}
    }
    
    class Soup2 {
    	private Soup2() {
    	}
    
    	private static Soup2 ps1 = new Soup2();
    
    	public static Soup2 access() {
    		return ps1;
    	}
    
    	public void f() {
    	}
    }

The classes Soup1 and Soup2 show how to prevent direct creation of a class by making all the constructors **private**.   
Remember that if you don’t explicitly create at least one constructor, the default constructor (a constructor with no arguments) will be created for you. By writing the default constructor, it won’t be created automatically. By making it private, no one can create an object of that class.   

But now how does anyone use this class? The preceding example shows two options. 

- In Soup1, a static method is created that creates a new Soup1 and returns a reference to it. This can be useful if you want to do some extra operations on the Soup1 before returning it, or if you want to keep count of how many Soup1 objects to create (perhaps to restrict their population).  


- Soup2 uses what’s called a design pattern, which is covered in Thinking in Patterns (with Java) at www.MindView.net.   
This particular pattern is called a **Singleton**, because it allows only a single object to ever be created. The object of class Soup2 is created as a static private member of Soup2, so there’s one and only one, and you can’t get at it except through the public method access( )

**注意：若一个默认类(package access)的一个static 成员的属性是public ，那么客户程序员（在package外）仍然能够访问那个static 成员——即使它们不能创建属于那个类的一个对象。**？？？？自己在eclipse上测试没通过？？？
