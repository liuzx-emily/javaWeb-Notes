There are two reasons for controlling access to members. 

- The first is to keep users’ hands off portions that they shouldn’t touch. These pieces are necessary for the internal operations of the class, but not part of the interface that the client programmer needs. So making methods and fields private is **a service to client programmers, because they can easily see what’s important to them and what they can ignore. It simplifies their understanding of the class.**
- The second and most important reason for access control is to **allow the library designer to change the internal workings of the class without worrying about how it will affect the client programmer.**   
You might, for example, build a class one way at first, and then discover that restructuring your code will provide much greater speed. If the interface and implementation are clearly separated and protected, you can accomplish this without forcing client programmers to rewrite their code. Access control ensures that no client programmer becomes dependent on any part of the underlying implementation of a class.
